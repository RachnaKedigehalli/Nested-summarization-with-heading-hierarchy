However, as time evolved, the definition of health also evolved. It cannot be stressed enough that health is the primary thing after which everything else follows. When you maintain good health, everything else falls into place.Similarly, maintaining good health is dependent on a lot of factors. It ranges from the air you breathe to the type of people you choose to spend your time with. Health has a lot of components that carry equal importance. If even one of them is missing, a person cannot be completely healthy. First, we have our physical health. This means being fit physically and in the absence of any kind of disease or illness. When you have good physical health, you will have a longer life span. One may maintain their physical health by having a balanced diet. Do not miss out on the essential nutrients; take each of them in appropriate quantities. Junk foods taste good thatâ€™s why it is mostly liked by everyone of any age group especially kids and school going children. They generally ask for the junk food daily because they have been trend so by their parents from the childhood. They never have been discussed by their parents about the harmful effects of junk foods over health. According to the research by scientists, it has been found that junk foods have negative effects on the health in many ways. They are generally fried food found in the market in the packets. They become high in calories, high in cholesterol, low in healthy nutrients, high in sodium mineral, high in sugar, starch, unhealthy fat, lack of protein and lack of dietary fibers. Processed and junk foods are the means of rapid and unhealthy weight gain and negatively impact the whole body throughout the life. It makes able a person to gain excessive weight which is called as obesity. Junk foods tastes good and looks good however do not fulfil the healthy calorie requirement of the body. Some of the foods like french fries, fried foods, pizza, burgers, candy, soft drinks, baked goods, ice cream, cookies, etc are the example of high-sugar and high-fat containing foods. It is found according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention that Kids and children eating junk food are more prone to the type-2 diabetes. \""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Pre-processing"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Expanding Contractions\n","Eg: he's -> he is"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-12T13:07:54.649062Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-12T13:07:54.648762Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-12T13:08:08.058451Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-12T13:08:08.057348Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-12T13:07:54.649031Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: contractions in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (0.1.72)\n","Requirement already satisfied: textsearch>=0.0.21 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from contractions) (0.0.21)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pyahocorasick in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from textsearch>=0.0.21->contractions) (1.4.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: anyascii in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from textsearch>=0.0.21->contractions) (0.3.1)\n","\u001b[33mWARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.
